## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- This is the first project of [frontend mentor](https://frontendmentor.io) .
I learned to follow general instructions of an img provided and recreate said img using html and css.
- Task wasn't that difficult and I managed to use basic knowledge of flexbox to replicate the layout as closely possible while making sure that the website is responsive. 
- light use of media queries made it possible to see slight difference between mobile and desktop. 
- Main difference is the addition of an img overlay that pops up on hovering the qr-code.
- Qr-code is scanable and redirects user to my [Github](https://github.com/Awesomejenkins) page

### Continued development

As of this point the basics of flexbox are beginning to settle, whilst I feel confident I'll actively continue to do projects with flexbox in increasing difficulty until I master the use of this. After that I'll start with CSS Grid.

This project didn't need any javaScript, but in the near future I'll try and add js to a project to increase some random functionality to at least practise with js.

## Acknowledgments

Most of what I've learned in that past few months is due to Kevin Powell  so big shout out to him, he has helped me understand how to break down a project into the building blocks need and start from a logical point.
